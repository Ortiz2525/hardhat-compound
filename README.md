# Compound V2 protocol deployment

The function `deployCompoundV2(CTokenDeployArg[], Signer): Promise<CompoundV2>`
deploys Comptroller, Interest rate models, SimplePriceOracle, and cTokens. cToken config is passed
in a form of `CTokenDeployArg`. Compound contract types are pre-generated by TypeChain.

```typescript
import { deployCompoundV2 } from "@thenextblock/hardhat-compound";

const cTokenDeployArgs = [
  {
    cToken: "cUSDC",
    underlying: "0x1234...",
    underlyingPrice: "1000000000000000000000000000000",
    collateralFactor: "750000000000000000",
  },
];

const {
  cTokens,
  comptroller,
  interestRateModels,
  priceOracle,
} = await deployCompoundV2(cTokenDeployArgs, deployer);
```
